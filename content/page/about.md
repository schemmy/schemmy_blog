Hello! Welcome to this site. 

My name is Chenxin Ma. I work as a staff data scientist at Walmart eCommerce. Previously I was a Research Scientist at JD Silicon Valley Research Center. In May 2018, I obtained my Ph.D in the Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering at Lehigh University. I received my B.S. degrees in both Economics and Mathematics from Nankai University, Tianjin, China and M.Sc. degree in Mathematical Finance from Rutgers University.

I am working with Dr. Martin Takáč in areas of non-linear optimization, design and analysis of algorithms, parallel and distributed computing and machine learning.
